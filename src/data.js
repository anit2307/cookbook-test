      preparation:
        "Season steak generously with kosher salt and pepper and let sit at room temperature 1 hour. Heat a dry large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high, then add oil. As soon as oil is smoking, cook steak, turning every 2 minutes or so, until a deep brown crust forms and the internal temperature is a few degrees below your favored doneness (120°–125° for medium-rare), 8–10 minutes. Add butter, rosemary, and garlic to skillet, tilt pan toward you so that butter pools on one side, and use a large spoon to continually baste steak with butter. Continue until butter is no longer bubbling and it smells nutty and is beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Transfer meat to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. (For medium-rare, your steak should reach an internal temperature of 125°–130°.) Cut meat from bone and slice against the grain 1' thick. Spoon some infused brown butter over steak and sprinkle with sea salt.",

      preparation:
        "Season chicken all over inside and out with salt and pepper (make sure to get in and around every nook and cranny; about 4 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 2½ tsp. Morton kosher salt). Place on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and let sit at room temperature while you make the garlic butter, or chill, uncovered, up to 1 day. If chilling, let sit at room temperature 1 hour before roasting. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325°. Coarsely chop 4 green garlic stalks; transfer to a food processor. Pulse until very finely chopped. Add butter and zest and pulse until almost smooth. Cut remaining 4 green garlic stalks in half lengthwise; set aside. Pat chicken dry again with paper towels (this will help the butter adhere and get the skin nicely browned). Smear garlic butter all over chicken. Gently lift the skin on the breast away from the flesh and rub some butter inside. Toss reserved green garlic and oil in a large cast-iron skillet or 13x9' baking dish to coat; season with salt. Tie chicken legs together with kitchen twine and tuck wings underneath back. Place chicken, breast side up, on top of garlic in skillet. Roast chicken, rotating pan halfway through for even browning, until skin is golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155° (don’t worry; temperature will climb to 165° as the chicken rests), 80–90 minutes. Let chicken rest at least 20 minutes and up to 45 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and carve as desired. Serve with roasted green garlic alongside.",

      preparation:
        "Heat oil in Instant Pot on Sauté setting (or heat over medium-high if using another pressure cooker). Add onion and bacon, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened and just beginning to brown and bacon has rendered some of its fat, 5–6 minutes. Meanwhile, cut collard leaves away from stems; discard stems. Cut leaves in half through the midline. Stack leaves and cut crosswise into 1'-thick strips. Add collards and chile to pot, season again with salt and pepper, and cook, tossing frequently, until collards are shiny and wilted, 3–4 minutes. Lock lid and cook on high pressure 12 minutes. Release pressure manually, then open lid and taste collards; adjust seasoning as needed. If there’s a lot of liquid in the pot, simmer on Sauté setting until reduced enough to lightly coat greens. Transfer collard greens to a platter. Season with hot sauce as desired.",

      preparation:
        "Parboil potatoes in a large pot of boiling salted water just until a paring knife slides into the center with some resistance, 15–20 minutes. Drain; transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and chill uncovered until cold, at least 30 minutes. Place racks in highest and lowest positions in oven; preheat to 425°. Line two 8' cake pans with parchment; brush with 2 Tbsp. oil. Toss onions, vinegar, and 1 Tbsp. kosher salt in a large bowl. Let sit until onions are softened, 5–10 minutes (massage gently to speed up process). Meanwhile, grate parboiled potatoes on a box grater or in a food processor, or cut using a julienne slicer. Place prepared pans on lower rack and heat 5 minutes. Add potatoes to onion mixture and toss to combine; season with kosher salt and pepper. Divide potato mixture between hot pans and press down as firmly as possible to compact (a thin flexible spatula works well). Place on lower rack and bake until potatoes are very brown around the edges, 45–60 minutes. Remove rösti from oven; let cool slightly. Heat broiler. Broil rösti on upper rack until tops are golden brown all over. Cut around sides with a small knife or offset spatula to loosen and invert rösti onto a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Carefully remove parchment paper (if potatoes stick, let cool slightly). Brush top of rösti with more oil, sprinkle with sea salt, and broil until second side is deep golden brown.",
